## [True review](https://truereview-frontend.vercel.app/)

This project is a web application that you can use to add reviews. The problem with traditional web applications is that it can be easily manipulated. PR comanies can make a good movies flop and a good movie hit. We solve this by implementing tokens. When a new user signs up he is given `100 tokens` when he add a review 50 token is deducted from his account. other users can downvote or upvote a review for each downvote the user loses `5 tokens` and for upvote user gets `10 tokens`. This way we can prevent manipulations.
